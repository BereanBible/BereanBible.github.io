        The Gospel’s Foolishness [Ch 1:18-30] <br />
        <br /> - The Gospel is foolish to the unsaved [Ch 1:18-25]
        <br /> - The gospel is foolishness to the unbeliever but to those being
        saved is is the power of God (1:18)
        <br /> - Quotes God’s Isaiah 29:14 promise to destroy/thwart the wisdom
        of the wise (1:18)
        <br /> - God has made the world’s wisdom foolish (1:20)
        <br /> - Because the world in its wisdom did not come to know God (in
        God’s wisdom this occurred) God was pleased to save those who believe
        through the foolishness of the Gospel (1:21)
        <br /> - “Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never
        know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save
        those who believe.”
        <br /> - The Gospel is offensive to the Jews (who want signs), and
        nonsense to the Greeks (who seek philosophy). (1:22-23)
        <br /> - However, to the Elect—Jew or greek—Christ is the power and
        wisdom of God (1:24)
        <br /> - God is totally wiser and stronger than men (1:25)

        <br /> - Using the lowly to shame the world's greatest [Ch 1:26-30]
        <br /> - The Corinthians God called were not wise, mighty, or noble
        (1:26)
        <br /> - God chose to use foolish and weak people to shame the worldly
        strong and the worldly wise, and to use what the world despises and
        considers nothing to bring down things the world considers important
        (1:27-28)
        <br /> - All so that no one may boast before God (1:29)
        <br /> - Through Christ, God imparts wisdom, righteousness,
        sanctification, and redemption to us (1:30)
        <br /> - Boast only about the Lord (1:31)
