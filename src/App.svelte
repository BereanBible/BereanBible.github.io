					The Gospel’s Foolishness [Ch 1:18-30] <br />
					<br /> - The Gospel is foolish to the unsaved [Ch 1:18-25]
					<br /> - The gospel is foolishness to the unbeliever but to
					those being saved is is the power of God (1:18)
					<br /> - Quotes God’s Isaiah 29:14 promise to destroy/thwart
					the wisdom of the wise (1:18)
					<br /> - God has made the world’s wisdom foolish (1:20)
					<br /> - Because the world in its wisdom did not come to
					know God (in God’s wisdom this occurred) God was pleased to
					save those who believe through the foolishness of the Gospel
					(1:21)
					<br /> - “Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world
					would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our
					foolish preaching to save those who believe.”
					<br /> - The Gospel is offensive to the Jews (who want
					signs), and nonsense to the Greeks (who seek philosophy).
					(1:22-23)
					<br /> - However, to the Elect—Jew or greek—Christ is the
					power and wisdom of God (1:24)
					<br /> - God is totally wiser and stronger than men (1:25)

					<br /> - Using the lowly to shame the world's greatest [Ch
					1:26-30]
					<br /> - The Corinthians God called were not wise, mighty,
					or noble (1:26)
					<br /> - God chose to use foolish and weak people to shame
					the worldly strong and the worldly wise, and to use what the
					world despises and considers nothing to bring down things
					the world considers important (1:27-28)
					<br /> - All so that no one may boast before God (1:29)
					<br /> - Through Christ, God imparts wisdom, righteousness,
					sanctification, and redemption to us (1:30)
					<br /> - Boast only about the Lord (1:31)

					In Thessalonica 17 When Paul and his companions had passed
					through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica,
					where there was a Jewish synagogue. 2 As was his custom,
					Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he
					reasoned with them from the Scriptures, 3 explaining and
					proving that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the
					dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah,”
					he said. 4 Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul
					and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and
					quite a few prominent women. 5 But other Jews were jealous;
					so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace,
					formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to
					Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring
					them out to the crowd.[a] 6 But when they did not find them,
					they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city
					officials, shouting: “These men who have caused trouble all
					over the world have now come here, 7 and Jason has welcomed
					them into his house. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees,
					saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.” 8 When
					they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were
					thrown into turmoil. 9 Then they made Jason and the others
					post bond and let them go. In Berea 10 As soon as it was
					night, the believers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On
					arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. 11 Now
					the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in
					Thessalonica, for they received the message with great
					eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if
					what Paul said was true. 12 As a result, many of them
					believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and
					many Greek men. 13 But when the Jews in Thessalonica learned
					that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, some of
					them went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them
					up. 14 The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but
					Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. 15 Those who escorted
					Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions
					for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. In
					Athens 16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was
					greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
					17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews and
					God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day
					with those who happened to be there. 18 A group of Epicurean
					and Stoic philosophers began to debate with him. Some of
					them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others
					remarked, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They
					said this because Paul was preaching the good news about
					Jesus and the resurrection. 19 Then they took him and
					brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said
					to him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are
					presenting? 20 You are bringing some strange ideas to our
					ears, and we would like to know what they mean.” 21 (All the
					Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their
					time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the
					latest ideas.) 22 Paul then stood up in the meeting of the
					Areopagus and said: “People of Athens! I see that in every
					way you are very religious. 23 For as I walked around and
					looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an
					altar with this inscription: to an unknown god. So you are
					ignorant of the very thing you worship—and this is what I am
					going to proclaim to you. 24 “The God who made the world and
					everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does
					not live in temples built by human hands. 25 And he is not
					served by human hands, as if he needed anything. Rather, he
					himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.
					26 From one man he made all the nations, that they should
					inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed
					times in history and the boundaries of their lands. 27 God
					did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out
					for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of
					us. 28 ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’[b]
					As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his
					offspring.’[c] 29 “Therefore since we are God’s offspring,
					we should not think that the divine being is like gold or
					silver or stone—an image made by human design and skill. 30
					In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he
					commands all people everywhere to repent. 31 For he has set
					a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man
					he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by
					raising him from the dead.” 32 When they heard about the
					resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others
					said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.” 33 At
					that, Paul left the Council. 34 Some of the people became
					followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a
					member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a
					number of others.
